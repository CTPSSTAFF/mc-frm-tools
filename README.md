# mc-frm-tools
Miscellaneous tools for working with the MC-FRM data.

The first versions of the scripts to query point/line/polygon layers against the 2050 MC-FRM probability polygon layer are _not_ parameterized.
That is to say, the input and output FileGeodatabases and output CSV directory are currently "hard-wired" in the script,
but these are to be parameterized when time is available. The intention here was to get work on these tools in its current - if not final - state
put under version control sooner rather than later.
